LIST OF FILES/FOLDERS:

-------------------------------------SERVER FOLDER-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.fileserver.c : This file creates a central server. File takes one commandline input arguments ie own listning port.
Clients will use Server IP and port to connect this server for publish and search files.
The code has following main operations:
JOIN : Whenever new client want to join network, server will be connected
PUBLISH : Clients can publish file to server for sharing with filename,filepath and 
their port no.Details of the file will be stored in publish list file. (filelist.txt)
SEARCH : Clients can search file using keyword . It uses bash script (searchscript.sh) for searching file in publish list.

2.filelist.txt :This file contains the list of files published by the peers.This file is maintained by server.It contains details in format:
file_name file_path peer_portno peer_IP_address.

3.searchscript.sh : This shell script is used by server to search the file using keyword in the published file list(filelist.txt) and create the output which is then send to client.The output will contain details of peers containing the given file.The peer IP,port NO and file path.

4.peerIPList.txt : This file contains log of IP addresses of the all peers which has connected with the server since it's up. It's maintained by server. 

------------------------------CLIENT FOLDER-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.fileclient.c : This file creates a peer. File takes three commandline input arguments server-ip,server port and own listning port.
Server IP and port will be used to connect the server and publish and search files.
Own listening port will be used to listen to incoming fetch requests from other peers.
The code has following main operations:
JOIN : Connects the peer server
PUBLISH : Publish file to server for sharing with filename,filepath and own port no.
SEARCH : Search file using keyword from server
FETCH :Fetch desired file from client using client IP,Port no, filename and path.If no path is given,file will be saved/fetched from client folder.The code also handle incoming file fetch requests from other clients in the background.
